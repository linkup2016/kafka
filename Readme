Kafka Wikimedia Changes Producer
This project is a Kafka producer that consumes recent changes events from the Wikimedia event stream and sends them to a Kafka topic.

To run locally,follow the following steps:

1. Download kafka and zookeeper from https://kafka.apache.org/downloads
2. Cd to the kafka-producer directory (e.g cd /OneDrive/IdeaProjects/Installed_Dev_Applications/Kafka/kafka_2.13-3.9.0)
3. Start Zookeeper: bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
4. Start Kafka: bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
5. Start the application.
5. To see the output of the producer or the topics run: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic wikimedia_latest --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092    on a new terminal

Source code analysis
1. The KafkaTopicConfig class creates a new topic.
2. The WikimediaChangesProducer class is the Kafka producer that consumes changes from the Wikimedia event stream and sends them to WikimediaChangesHandler class for further processing.
3. The WikimediaChangesHandler class implements an event handler class so that it listens to any event coming from source.
4. The wikimediaChangesHandler class, upon receiving of an event, uses kafka template to send the event to the Kafka topic.
5. The kafka cluster that you started listens to the topic created by KafkaTopicConfig class on port 9092.
6. The topics will remain on the Kafka cluster depending on your settings for the kafka producer in the application.yaml file.
7. You can see the topics by running: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic wikimedia_latest --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
8. You should also see the same in the application console at the bottom of the screen.
9. The producer is started by calling the sendMessage() method from the main class.

The Consumer
1. Consumer is built the same way as the producer, but instead of sending messages, it consumes them.
2. The listener method sits in the KafkaService class. Need to pass the same topic name as the producer.
3. You can run both the producer and the consumer simultaneously on the same intellij window see events produced and consumed at the same time.
1. Consumer: bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic wikimedia_latest --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
