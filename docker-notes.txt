Docker

is a tool that helps developers build, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.
Think of it as a "container" system that bundles up everything an application needs (code, libraries, dependencies, etc.) into one package.
This makes it easy to run the application on any computer without worrying about compatibility issues.

Docker's english meaning is someone or something that is responsible for containing things in a container and set them up for transport.
Same way, Docker is a tool that contains an application and its environment for transport. The contaiers are self-contained and can run on any machine.

A Docker Image

In Docker, an image is like a blueprint or a template that defines everything your application needs to run, such as:

The application code.
Runtime environment (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js).
Dependencies and libraries.
System tools or configurations.
Think of it as a snapshot of your application and its environment, all bundled together.

Snapshot is a term used to describe a point in time when something happens. Just like a snapshot picture of your kid at his birthday party, it's a snapshot of your application and its environment at a specific moment.
It may change over time as your application grows or evolves.

A Docker image is the blueprint (template) of your application and its environment. When you run the image, Docker creates a container from it. The container the app that runs.
