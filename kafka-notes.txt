TOPICS and PARTITIONS

Within a Kafka cluster, messages are stored, not the topics themselves.

Here’s the breakdown to clarify:

What is Stored in Kafka?
Messages:

These are the actual units of data (events) that Kafka processes and delivers.
Examples of messages:
"Order ID: 123, Amount: $45"
"Temperature: 25°C, Time: 12:00 PM"
Topics (Logical Containers):

A topic is just a logical abstraction—a named category or "label" used to organize and group messages.
Kafka doesn't store the "topic" itself as a physical entity. Instead:
Messages are stored inside partitions, which are part of topics.
Each topic is divided into one or more partitions.
Partitions:

Partitions are the physical storage units within Kafka.
Messages are written to and stored in these partitions.
Partitions exist as actual files on disk in Kafka brokers.
How It Works in Practice
When a producer sends a message to Kafka:

Topic as a Label: The producer specifies the topic (e.g., Orders) for the message.
Partition for Storage: Kafka determines which partition of the topic will store the message (based on keys, round-robin, or other logic).
Message Storage: The message is stored within the partition on the Kafka broker.

Kafka Cluster (made up of brokers):
    Broker 1:
        Partition 0 (of Topic "Orders"): [Message 1, Message 2, ...]
        Partition 1 (of Topic "Payments"): [Message 1, Message 2, ...]

    Broker 2:
        Partition 1 (of Topic "Orders"): [Message 3, Message 4, ...]
        Partition 0 (of Topic "Payments"): [Message 3, Message 4, ...]
Summary
Messages are the actual data being stored in Kafka.
Partitions (inside topics) are the physical structures where these messages are stored.
Topics are just logical names that organize and route messages but aren’t stored themselves.
Think of it like this:
Kafka clusters store messages inside partitions, and topics are like "folders" pointing to those partitions.

Topic: Orders
    Partition 0: Electronics Orders
        Message 1
        Message 2
        ...
    Partition 1: Clothing Orders
        Message 1
        Message 2
        ...
    Partition 2: Grocery Orders
        Message 1
        Message 2
        ...
Partitions are like "lanes on a highway," each processing a subset of the topic's events independently.
Brokers manage the partitions where events are stored.

AVRO and SCHEMA REGISTRY

How Do Avro and the Schema Registry Work Together?

Producer Workflow:{

}
The producer defines the schema for the data it wants to send.
It registers the schema with the Schema Registry, which assigns the schema a unique ID (e.g., schema_id = 5).
The producer serializes the data using the schema, embedding only the schema ID (not the full schema) in the message.
The serialized message (binary format) is sent to a Kafka topic.
Consumer Workflow:
The consumer receives the serialized message from the Kafka topic.
It extracts the schema ID from the message and queries the Schema Registry to fetch the correct schema.
Using the schema, the consumer deserializes the message into a readable format (e.g., JSON, object in memory).
